## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The implementation includes:

- Fit method to train the model using the input data.
- Predict method to make predictions on new data.
- Evaluation method to compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for model evaluation.
- Visualization method to plot the actual vs. predicted values.

## K-means Clustering

K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into K clusters based on similarity. The implementation includes:

- Fit method to cluster the input data into K clusters.
- Visualization method to plot the centroids and clusters.

## Decision Trees

Decision trees are a versatile machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The implementation includes:

- Fit method to build a decision tree model from the input data.
- _Gini_impurity method to compute the Gini impurity measure.
- _Find_best_split method to find the best split for constructing the decision tree.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, make sure you have the required Python packages installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use these implementations, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the algorithm you want to use (e.g., Linear Regression):

   ```bash
   cd machine-learning-algorithms/linear_regression
   ```

3. Import the respective class into your Python script:

   ```python
   from linear_regression import LinearRegression
   ```

4. Create an instance of the class and use its methods:

   ```python
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   mse = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
   model.visualize(X_test, y_test)
   ```

5. Follow similar steps for using K-means Clustering and Decision Trees implementations.
